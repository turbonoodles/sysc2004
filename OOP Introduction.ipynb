    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A category or type of thing (compare `struct` in C). A template or a blueprint. Unlike a `struct` in C, can contain both data and *instructions* that may be performed on the data stored in the class. The class should describe all objects of a particular kind in an *abstract* way.\n",

    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An *object* belongs to a particular class and has individual characteristics. An instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a class grading app, `Student` may be declared as a class. Objects `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charles` represent the individual students in the class. `Student.average()` could return the grade point average for a particular student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We communicate with objects by invoking methods on them. An object is usually expected to do something when its methods are called.\n"
