    "\n",
    "The ability to ignore implementation details in order to focus our attention on a higher-level problem. For example, we need not track every electron through a circuit in order to know what the circuit actually does.\n",

    "\n",
    "Breaking the problem into smaller, well-defined parts, which can be built and tested separately. These parts must interact in well-defined ways. For example, to build a car, we might first build an engine. To build an engine, we might first build a block with cylinders. It is now important that the piston fits within the cylinder.\n",
